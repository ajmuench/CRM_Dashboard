This project showcases the development of a comprehensive Tableau dashboard that visually explores RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) customer segmentation and CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value) for the year 2010-2011. It leverages data from the Kaggle Online Retail II dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/online-retail-ii-data-set-from-ml-repository?select=Year+2010-2011.csv) and incorporates this Python workbook (https://www.kaggle.com/code/nihandincer/customer-relationship-management-crm#And-Finally...CRM!) for data preprocessing.

Goals:

Create interactive visualizations to analyze customer behavior patterns.
Identify and segment customers based on RFM characteristics.
Calculate CLTV for customer groups and gain insights into their lifetime value.
Leverage Tableau's functionalities to provide an engaging and informative dashboard experience.
